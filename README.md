# Particle "Collision" Simulation #
A toy program for an assignment in my stochastic processes class: Given a 2x3 board of 5 particles and one empty spot, determine the stochastic matrix and invariant measure of the chain where each move has equal probability. Run it in release mode or turn the iterations down. While the stochastic matrix was done on paper, this was a small project to apply something and verify the work already done.
